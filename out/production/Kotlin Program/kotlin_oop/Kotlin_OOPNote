# Kotlin Constructors
The main purpose of constructor is to initialize the properties of a class. Constructor is called when we
create the object of a class.
In Kotlin we have two types of constructor – primary and secondary constructor.
1. Primary Constructor – Initialize the properties of class
2. Secondary Constructor – Initialize the properties of class,
 we can have additional initialization code inside secondary constructor.
 1. Primary Constructor
 A primary constructor is the easiest way to initialize the class. It is declared as part of the class header.
  In the following example we have declared a constructor (val name: String, var age: Int) as part of the class header.
  This is our primary constructor that initializes the name and age properties (data members) of class Student.
